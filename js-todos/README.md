# JS Todos Exercise
This is for UNIT 4.4 Springboard Software Engineer Bootcamp

### Part 1
For this assignment you will be combing your knowledge of DOM access and events to build a todo app! As a user, you should be able to:
- Add a new todo (by submitting a form)
- Mark a todo as completed (cross out the text of the todo)
- Remove a todo

### Part 2
Now that you have a functioning todo app, save your todos in a localStorage! Make sure that when the page refreshes, the todos on the page remain there
